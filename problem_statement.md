# Sale Price Prediction

Design ML pipeline to process input data, train model, test and evaluate results. The dataset contains 2 years worth of vehicle sales data. Data consist of variety of data types that needs to be processed. 

The assignment is focusing on following areas:
## Data processing:
- Data cleansing
- Feature engineering
- Scaling, encoding
## Model training and testing
- Selecting the right type of model for the given task
- Training and testing process
## Evaluation
- Choosing the right metric
- Presentation of results
## Code review
- Code style
- Code smell
- Annotation

## Expected outcome:
- Executable code demonstrating data processing and model training
- Evaluation demonstrating comparison of model predictions to true values (visual evaluation appreciated)
